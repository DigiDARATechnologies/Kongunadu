# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook walks through the steps of building, training, and evaluating an RNN model for sequential data processing.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and loading
- RNN model architecture definition
- Training and evaluation of the model
- Performance visualization

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The notebook utilizes a time-series or sequential dataset for training and testing. If no dataset is provided, synthetic data is generated.

## Model Architecture
The RNN model consists of the following layers:
1. **Embedding Layer** - Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
2. **Recurrent Layer (LSTM/GRU/RNN)** - Captures temporal dependencies.
3. **Dense Layer** - Outputs predictions based on the learned features.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and a suitable loss function, depending on the task (e.g., mean squared error for regression or categorical cross-entropy for classification).

### Training Parameters:
- **Epochs:** 10-50 (configurable)
- **Batch Size:** 32-64
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001 (adjustable)

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, or RMSE.

## Results
- Plots of training vs validation loss
- Accuracy trends over epochs
- Sample predictions

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_folder>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook rnn.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cell by cell.

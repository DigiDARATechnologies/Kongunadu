## **Project Categories and Descriptions**

### **1️⃣ Supervised Learning**
**📌 Description:**  
Supervised learning algorithms use labeled data to train models for regression or classification tasks.

- **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso
- **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes
- **Deep Learning:** Basic Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for structured data

🔗 **Path:** [`Supervised/`](./Supervised)

### **2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning**
**📌 Description:**  
Unsupervised learning techniques find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

- **Clustering Algorithms:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

🔗 **Path:** [`Unsupervised/`](./Unsupervised)

### **3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning**
**📌 Description:**  
Reinforcement learning models learn optimal actions through rewards and penalties.

- **DASCIENT-RLBot:** An RL-based chatbot implementation

🔗 **Path:** [`Reinforcement/DASCIENT-RLBot/`](./Reinforcement/DASCIENT-RLBot)
